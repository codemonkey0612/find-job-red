```

```

  - Edit mode toggle
  - Basic info display (name, email, phone, location)

### Backend Changes (/server)

#### 1. Database Schema (`server/database/`)

**New Migration File:**
- `add_profile_experience_education.sql` ✅ Applied

**Tables Created:**
```sql
✅ user_experiences (11 columns)
   - Stores work experience entries
   - Foreign key to users table
   
✅ user_educations (10 columns)
   - Stores education entries
   - Foreign key to users table
```

**Columns Added to `users` table:**
```sql
✅ avatar_url VARCHAR(500)
✅ auth_provider ENUM('local', 'google', 'linkedin')
✅ provider_id VARCHAR(255)
✅ Modified password_hash to allow NULL
```

#### 2. API Endpoints (`server/src/routes/auth.ts`)

**Updated GET `/api/auth/me`:**
```typescript
✅ Returns user.experiences[] array
✅ Returns user.educations[] array
✅ Returns avatar_url and OAuth fields
```

**Updated PUT `/api/auth/profile`:**
```typescript
✅ Accepts experiences array (creates/updates/deletes)
✅ Accepts educations array (creates/updates/deletes)
✅ Accepts email field
✅ Returns updated user profile with nested data
✅ Validates all input fields
```

**Existing POST `/api/auth/upload-avatar`:**
```typescript
✅ Already functional
✅ Max file size: 10MB
✅ Allowed types: jpeg, jpg, png, gif, webp
```

#### 3. Bug Fixes Applied

**Fixed Password Reset DateTime Format:**
```typescript
❌ Before: expiresAt.toISOString() 
   -> '2025-10-14T13:13:38.309Z' (MySQL rejects)
   
✅ After: expiresAt.toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace('T', ' ')
   -> '2025-10-14 13:13:38' (MySQL accepts)
```

**Fixed Password Reset Column Name:**
```typescript
❌ Before: UPDATE users SET password = ?
✅ After: UPDATE users SET password_hash = ?
```

**Locations Fixed:**
- `/api/auth/forgot-password` endpoint (line ~1380)
- `/api/auth/reset-password` endpoint (line ~1466, 1487)
